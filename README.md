Malware IP Address Miner

Simple script that watches a directory for new files and extracts IP addresses from them. Created as a supplement for honeypots like Kippo or Cowrie that store incoming malware in one folder. The goal of this project is to immediatelly extract the IP addresses contained in files uploaded by attackers.
